# Rendered reader-page scanner

This separate Playwright/Chromium service evaluates the full public reader page with axe-core WCAG 2.1 A/AA tags. It does not contain CXone write credentials or inference keys. The browser runs as `pwuser` with the Chromium sandbox; the included Playwright seccomp profile permits user namespaces. Use the private Docker network only; do not publish port 5180.

Copy `compose.example.yml` to the deployment compose file. Create a mode-600 `browser-scanner.env` containing a generated `RENDER_SCANNER_TOKEN`. Set that same token and `RENDER_SCANNER_URL=http://remedy-browser-scanner:5180` in the Bridge environment. `RENDER_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is an explicit comma-separated resource-host allowlist. Every allowed host is resolved to a public IPv4 address and pinned for each browser lifetime; all other DNS names and non-GET/HEAD requests are blocked. Resource blocking is reported as incomplete evidence, not silently ignored.

`POST /scan` accepts `{ "url": "https://dev.libretexts.org/Sandboxes/johnnyphung/..." }` with Bearer authentication. Requests outside the sandbox are rejected. Only one scan runs at a time (429 while busy). MathJax v2 queues and v3/v4 startup promises are awaited. Missing reader content, redirects outside the page, MathJax errors and timeouts fail closed. The result records browser/axe versions, viewport, source-independent rendered content and script/CSS hashes, load errors, axe violations/incomplete results and rule coverage.

Bridge's existing `/v1/cxone/page/scan` accepts `rendered: true`; the gateway forwards this field. A source-only scan preserves browser evidence only when the source hash is unchanged. Browser evidence supersedes a source axe execution error only if MathJax is ready and the browser explicitly passed that rule (or found it inapplicable). Original execution errors remain in `resolvedSourceChecks`. An incomplete full-page load adds an explicit readiness finding and still blocks Conductor sign-off, even when an individual rule completes. Confirmed source failures remain open.

Browser scans are evidence, not certification. Screen-reader math semantics, exploration, duplicate speech, keyboard operation, complete processes, visual and linguistic review still require human testing. Resource hashes conservatively invalidate reviews when relevant rendering changes. Future page changes cannot be detected until rescanning; Conductor requires scans within 24 hours for current sign-off.

Validation: `npm ci && npm test` in this directory; Bridge integration tests run in the core workspace. The seccomp profile is from Microsoft Playwright v1.63.0 (`utils/docker/seccomp_profile.json`).

## Duplicate initialization

Copied pages can contain a MathJax initializer in addition to the reader's platform initializer. A live-page fixture comparison reproduced a pending MathJax 4 startup promise with two loaders and successful startup with one. `node tools/repair-mathjax-initializer.mjs <sandbox-page-url>` previews a guarded cleanup; add `--apply` to write with a restore snapshot. It requires exactly one authored loader and two matching rendered loaders, allowing only the known copied 0.85/platform 1 scale difference. Custom configuration is retained for manual review. Equation markup and CSS are preserved byte-for-byte; this does not verify mathematical meaning or speech quality.

The worker identifies itself as `LibreTexts-Remedy-Accessibility/1.0`; some reader deployments reject the default HeadlessChrome user agent. The actual CXone article selector is `section.mt-content-container`; the header's optional login form does not imply that the article requires authentication. MathJax timeouts retain partial axe evidence and explicit readiness errors. Blocked write/telemetry requests are recorded separately from blocked read resources; write-based processes still require reviewer tests. Render fingerprints include the reader shell and loaded image/font/script/CSS assets.

Run native MathML regression tests inside the worker container with `RUN_BROWSER_TESTS=1 npm test`. They exercise fractions, exponents and hidden MathML while confirming real invalid ARIA still fails.
